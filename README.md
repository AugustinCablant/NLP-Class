# README - NLP Course at ENSAE Paris

This repository contains the work and project for the NLP course at ENSAE Paris, taught by **Christopher Kermovant** with supervision by **Houri Yasmine**. The course consists of both practical works (TP) and a final project. The aim is to explore Natural Language Processing techniques and apply them to real-world data while documenting the process in a scientific mini-article.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into practical work (TP) sessions and a final project. Below is the organization of the repository:

```plaintext

├── TP1 
├── TP2 
├── TP3 
└── TP4
```

Each folder (`TP1`, `TP2`, `TP3`, `TP4`) contains the work and exercises related to the corresponding practical work session. Each TP includes coding exercises, experiments, and discussions relevant to the NLP topics covered.

## Evaluation of the Course

### **Personal Project**

The assessment for this course is based on a personal project, where students will conduct an experiment on a chosen NLP problem. The project consists of writing a scientific mini-article that reports the experiment and includes the following steps:

1. **Choice of an NLP problem**: Select an NLP problem for which there are reference data and state-of-the-art results published in peer-reviewed conferences or journals.
   
2. **Brief state-of-the-art**: Provide a concise review of the current state-of-the-art approaches and results for the chosen NLP problem.

3. **Proposal and justification of an experiment**: Propose an experiment to evaluate a model, justifying the chosen approach and the evaluation criteria.

4. **Retrieve, format, and describe the data**: Collect and preprocess the data. Provide statistical descriptions of the dataset(s) used in the experiment.

5. **Experiments with the proposed model**: Implement and run experiments with the proposed model, ensuring the experiments are reproducible and well-documented.

6. **Analysis of results and conclusion**: Analyze the results obtained from the experiments and conclude with insights about the effectiveness of the model.

### **Article Formatting**

The article should follow the layout and style of the **NEURIPS conference**. You can find the template for NEURIPS 2024 here: [NEURIPS 2024 Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2024/tpsbbrdqcmsh).

### **Repository Contents**

- **Code**: All the code used for the experiments and data processing should be placed in this repository.
- **PDF Version of the Article**: The final scientific mini-article should be stored in PDF format within the repository.

### **Submission Guidelines**

Both the **code** and the **PDF** version of the article should be uploaded to a GitHub repository for submission. Please ensure that your repository is well-organized, documented, and includes clear instructions for running the code.

## Project Organization

- **TP1 to TP4**: Each directory contains the practical work (TP) for each session, with the corresponding code, instructions, and results for each exercise.
- **Final Project**: Your project should be placed in the root of this repository, containing your scientific article in PDF format along with the source code for your experiments.
