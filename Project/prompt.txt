Chapter 1: KING’S CROSS

The station was bustling with life, filled with people hurrying to their destinations. Among the crowd, two large cages rattled atop two heavily loaded trolleys. James Potter and Albus Potter pushed them forward, while their mother, Ginny, followed closely behind. A little further ahead, a thirty-seven-year-old man, Harry Potter, walked with purpose, his daughter Lily perched on his shoulders.

"Dad, he keeps saying it," Albus muttered, glancing at his father.

Harry shot a look at James.

"James, give it a rest."

"I only said he might end up in Slytherin. And he might, after all…" James trailed off as his father’s gaze hardened. "Fine, fine."

Albus looked up at his mother.

"You’ll write to me, won’t you?"

"Every day if you want us to," Ginny said with a reassuring smile.

"No… not every day," Albus hesitated. "James says most people only get letters from home about once a month. I don’t want to—"

"We wrote to your brother three times a week last year," Harry interrupted.

Albus turned to James, glaring at him.

"James!"

Ginny chuckled.

"You don’t have to believe everything your brother tells you about Hogwarts. He enjoys a good joke."

James grinned.

"Can we go now, please?"

Albus looked from his father to his mother, hesitating for a moment.

"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten," Ginny explained.

"I can’t wait!" Lily exclaimed.

"Don’t stop, and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it—that’s very important," Harry added. "If you’re nervous, it’s best to do it at a run."

Albus took a deep breath.

"I’m ready."

Harry and Lily placed their hands on Albus’s trolley, while Ginny walked beside James. Together, the family broke into a run, heading straight for the magical barrier.


Chapter 2: PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
A thick white cloud of steam billowed from the Hogwarts Express, enveloping the platform in a swirling mist. The station was bustling with movement, but instead of businesspeople in sharp suits rushing about their day, it was witches and wizards in flowing robes, saying their heartfelt goodbyes to their children.

Albus Potter stood still for a moment, taking it all in.

“This is it,” he murmured.

Beside him, Lily gazed around, wide-eyed. “Wow.”

Albus glanced at the sign above the arched entrance. “Platform Nine and Three-Quarters,” he said.

Lily turned her head quickly, scanning the crowd. “Where are they? Are they here? Maybe they didn’t come?”

Harry, standing just behind them, pointed through the steam. “There,” he said.

Ron, Hermione, and their daughter, Rose, were standing a little way off. At the sight of them, Lily took off at a run.

“Uncle Ron! Uncle Ron!”

Ron turned just in time to catch her as she barreled into him. With a laugh, he lifted her into the air.

“Well, if it isn’t my favorite Potter,” he said, grinning.

Lily giggled. “Did you bring my trick?”

Ron’s expression turned serious. “Have you heard of the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes–certified Nose-Stealing Breath?”

Rose groaned. “Mum! Dad’s doing that lame thing again.”

Hermione sighed. “You say lame, he says glorious. I say… somewhere in between.”

Ron ignored them both. He lifted an imaginary something to his mouth. “Hang on. Let me just munch this… air. And now it’s just a simple matter of… excuse me if I smell slightly of garlic…” He exhaled dramatically in Lily’s face.

Lily wrinkled her nose. “You smell like porridge.”

“Bing. Bang. Boing,” Ron said, waggling his fingers. “Young lady, get ready for a world without smell.” He reached forward, pretended to grab her nose, and then held up his empty hand. “Ta-da!”

Lily gasped in mock horror. “Where’s my nose?”

Ron smirked. “Vanished.”

Everyone laughed at the sheer ridiculousness of the trick.

“You’re silly,” Lily declared.

Albus, standing slightly apart, shuffled uncomfortably. “Everyone’s staring at us again.”

Ron puffed out his chest. “Because of me! I’m extremely famous. My nose experiments are legendary.”

Hermione rolled her eyes. “They’re certainly… something.”

Harry, smiling, clapped Ron on the shoulder. “Parked all right, then?”

Ron nodded proudly. “I did. Hermione didn’t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? Thought I’d have to Confund the examiner.”

Hermione huffed. “I thought nothing of the sort. I had complete faith in you.”

Rose smirked. “And I have complete faith that he did Confund the examiner.”

Ron looked scandalized. “Oi!”

Albus tugged on Harry’s robes. “Dad…”

Harry looked down.

Albus hesitated. Then, in a small voice, he asked, “Do you think—what if I am—what if I’m put in Slytherin?”

Harry studied him for a moment. “And what would be wrong with that?”

Albus frowned. “Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic… It’s not a House for brave wizards.”

Harry crouched slightly so that he was eye-level with his son. “Albus Severus,” he said softly, “you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin, and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”

Albus chewed his lip. “But just say—”

“If it matters to you,” Harry interrupted, “the Sorting Hat will take your feelings into account.”

Albus blinked. “Really?”

Harry smiled. “It did for me.”

For a moment, Albus simply stared at him. It was something his father had never told him before, and it echoed in his mind.

“Hogwarts will be the making of you, Albus,” Harry continued. “I promise, there’s nothing to be afraid of.”

“Except the Thestrals,” said James, strolling up behind them. “Watch out for the Thestrals.”

Albus frowned. “I thought they were invisible?”

Harry gave James a pointed look. “Listen to your professors, don’t listen to James, and remember to enjoy yourself. Now, if you don’t want this train to leave without you, you’d better get on.”

Lily grinned. “I’m going to chase the train out!”

“Lily, come straight back,” Ginny called.

Nearby, Hermione gave Rose a quick squeeze. “Remember to send Neville our love.”

Rose made a face. “Mum, I can’t just give a professor love.”

Nevertheless, she turned and hurried towards the train. Albus hesitated for just a second before stepping forward and embracing both his parents one last time.

“Okay, then. Bye.”

And with that, he turned and climbed aboard.

Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione stood side by side, watching the train as it prepared to depart. Steam curled around them, whistles blew up and down the platform, and slowly, the train began to move.

“They’re going to be okay, right?” Ginny asked.

Hermione smiled. “Hogwarts is a big place.”

“Big,” Ron agreed. “Wonderful. Full of food. I’d give anything to be going back.”

Harry, still watching the train, murmured, “Strange… Al being worried he’ll be sorted into Slytherin.”

“That’s nothing,” Hermione said. “Rose is worried about whether she’ll break the Quidditch scoring record in her first or second year. And how early she can take her O.W.L.s.”

Ron grinned. “I have no idea where she gets her ambition from.”

Ginny turned to Harry. “And how would you feel, Harry, if Al… if he is?”

Ron chuckled. “You know, Gin, we always thought you might end up in Slytherin.”

Ginny’s head snapped around. “What?”

“Honestly, Fred and George ran a book on it.”

Hermione sighed. “Can we go? People are staring.”

Ginny glanced around. She lowered her voice. “People always stare when you three are together. Even apart, people always stare at you.”

Slowly, the four of them turned and made their way out of the station. Just as they were about to leave, Ginny reached for Harry’s hand.

“Harry… He’ll be all right, won’t he?”

Harry squeezed her fingers. “Of course he will.”


Chapter 3: The Hogwarts Express
Albus and Rose made their way down the train corridor, peering into compartments as they passed. The trolley witch was coming the other way, pushing her cart laden with sweets.

"Anything from the trolley, dears?" she asked cheerfully. "Pumpkin Pasties? Chocolate Frogs? Cauldron Cakes?"

Albus hesitated, eyeing the Chocolate Frogs longingly.

"Al, we need to concentrate," Rose said, tugging his sleeve.

"Concentrate on what?"

"On who we choose to be friends with," Rose said importantly. "My mum and dad met your dad on their first trip to Hogwarts, you know..."

Albus frowned. "So we have to pick our friends for life right now? That’s… a lot of pressure."

"On the contrary, it’s exciting," Rose declared. "I’m a Granger-Weasley, you’re a Potter—everyone will want to be friends with us. We can choose anyone we like."

Albus wasn’t sure he liked the sound of that, but before he could say anything, he opened a compartment door.

Inside sat a lone blond boy—Scorpius Malfoy. His pale face brightened at the sight of them.

"Hi," Albus said. "Is this compartment—?"

"It’s free," Scorpius said quickly. "It’s just me."

Albus hesitated, then stepped inside. "Great. Maybe we’ll sit here for a bit—if that’s okay?"

"Of course," Scorpius said eagerly. "Hi. I’m Scorpius."

"I’m Albus," Albus said, returning the smile.

Scorpius turned to Rose. "And you must be…?"

Rose’s expression had cooled considerably. "Rose," she said shortly.

Scorpius, undeterred, reached into a small bag and held out a packet. "Would you like some Fizzing Whizbees?"

"I’ve just had breakfast, thanks," Rose said stiffly.

Scorpius shrugged. "I’ve got Shock-o-Choc, Pepper Imps, and Jelly Slugs too. Mum packed them all—she says sweets help you make friends." He hesitated, then added awkwardly, "Probably a stupid idea."

Albus grinned. "I’ll have some! Mum doesn’t let me have sweets often. Which should I try first?"

Rose gave him a sharp nudge under the table.

Scorpius brightened. "Pepper Imps, definitely. They make your ears smoke!"

Albus reached for the bag, but Rose nudged him again.

"Will you stop that?" Albus complained.

"I’m not doing anything," Rose said primly.

Albus rubbed his arm, frowning at her.

Scorpius sighed. "She’s doing it because of me."

Albus turned to him. "What?"

"I know who you are," Scorpius said. "So it’s only fair you know who I am."

Albus blinked. "What do you mean?"

"My parents are Astoria and Draco Malfoy," Scorpius said, his voice quieter now. "And our families… well, they didn’t exactly get along."

Rose sniffed. "That’s an understatement. Your dad was a Death Eater."

Scorpius flinched. "He was. But my mum wasn’t."

A tense silence fell between them. Scorpius hesitated, then pressed on.

"I know what people say about me. That my parents… couldn’t have children. That my father and grandfather were so desperate for a powerful heir, they—" He swallowed. "That they used a Time-Turner to send my mother back."

Albus frowned. "Send her back where?"

Rose crossed her arms. "The rumor is that he’s Voldemort’s son, Albus."

A heavy silence followed. Then, suddenly, Rose wrinkled her nose.

"But you’ve got a nose, so that seems unlikely."

Scorpius laughed, startled. "And it’s exactly like my father’s! I got his nose, his hair, and his name. Not that that’s great either. Father-son issues, I have them. But, well… I’d rather be a Malfoy than the son of the Dark Lord."

Albus looked at Scorpius, then at Rose. Something inside him twisted uncomfortably.

Rose stood. "Come on, Albus. We should sit somewhere else."

Albus didn’t move.

"No," he said.

Rose frowned. "Albus."

"You go on," Albus said, glancing at Scorpius. "I’m fine here."

Rose huffed. "Fine!" And with that, she swept out of the compartment.

Scorpius and Albus sat in silence for a moment.

Scorpius shifted. "Thank you."

Albus shrugged. "I didn’t stay for you. I stayed for your sweets."

Scorpius grinned, popping two Pepper Imps into his mouth. A second later, smoke billowed from his ears.

"THANK YOU FOR STAYING FOR MY SWEETS, ALBUS!" he declared, his voice slightly muffled by the smoke.

Albus laughed. "Wow."
